Task: You are working on a feature but need to quickly switch to another task without committing your current changes.

Steps:

1.Make changes to a file but do not commit them.

-> echo "Working on feature" > feature3.txt
   git add feature3.txt

2.Stash the changes.

-> git stash

3.Verify that your working directory is clean.

-> git status

4.Apply the stashed changes back.

-> git stash apply

5.Experiment with other stash commands like stash list, stash pop, and stash drop.

-> git stash list-This command shows all stashed changes with an index number.

   git stash pop-This applies the most recent stash and removes it from the stash list.

   git stash drop stash@{0}-Replace stash@{0} with the appropriate index if you want to drop a specific stash.
