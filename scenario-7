Steps to create a conflict:

1.Create a repository and add a file named project.txt.

-> mkdir gitworkshopart3assignment
  cd gitworkshopart3assignment
  git init 
  echo "This is a shared project file." > project.txt
  git add project.txt
  git commit -m "Initial commit"

2.Create two branches in the repository.

-> git branch branch1
  git branch branch2

3.Make changes to the same line and in the same file in both branches.

-> git checkout branch1
  echo "This is a shared project file, modified in branch1." > project.txt
  git checkout branch2
  echo "This is a shared project file, modified in branch2." > project.txt


4.Commit the changes in both branches.

-> git checkout branch1
  git add project.txt
  git commit -m "Modified project.txt in branch1"
  git checkout branch2
  git add project.txt
  git commit -m "Modified project.txt in branch2"

5.Merge one branch into the main first and then try to merge the second branch.

-> git checkout main
  git merge branch1
  git merge branch2
 

6.Understand the message that appears when you try to merge the second branch and explain that message. In case of conflicts explain the steps taken to resolve the conflict.

-> "Auto-merging project.txt
  CONFLICT (content): Merge conflict in project.txt
  Automatic merge failed; fix conflicts and then commit the result."

 This message indicates that there is a conflict in project.txt that Git couldn't resolve automatically. The conflict occurs because both branch1 and branch2 made changes to the same lines in the file.
