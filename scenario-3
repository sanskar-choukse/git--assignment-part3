Task: You have just made a commit but realize you forgot to include a file and make a small typo correction. Instead of creating a new commit, you can amend the last commit to include these changes without altering the commit message. Also verify the amended commit by checking the commit log.

Steps:

1.Create and commit initial files.

-> echo "Initial content" > file1.txt
   echo "Initial content" > file2.txt
   git add file1.txt file2.txt
   git commit -m "Initial commit"
   
2.Make additional changes.

-> echo "Forgotten content" > file3.txt
   echo "Corrected typo" > file1.txt

3.Stage the changes and amend the last commit.

-> git add file3.txt file1.txt
   git commit --amend --no-edit
   "The --amend option allows you to modify the last commit, and --no-edit keeps the existing commit message unchanged."

4.Verify the amended commit by checking the commit log.

-> git log
